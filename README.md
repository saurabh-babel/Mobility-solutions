**Responsibilities performed:**

- Built efficient and reusable front-end systems that drive Babel&#39;s state-of-the-art web applications
- Collaborated with Product Designers, Marketing Managers, Product Managers, and Software Engineers to deliver compelling user-facing products
- Interact with other team members to incorporate their innovations and vice versa
- Identify and resolve performance bottlenecks and scalability issues in the front end systems

**Objective:**

Designing front end systems constituting dashboards and charts that can be plotted using the given data (the data can be fetched from any source) using ReactJs.

**Abstract:**

In this project, we&#39;ve used the power and efficiency of ReactJS Javascript library to design front end systems that can be used to display web designs. We&#39;ve also plotted different bar charts and line charts using ChartJs (open-source JavaScript library for data visualisation).

Different interactive images (gifs) and tables are also incorporated in the project.

This project is created referring to the Figma design provided by the project manager.

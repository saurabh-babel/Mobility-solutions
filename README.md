**Abstract:**

In this project, we&#39;ve used the power and efficiency of ReactJS Javascript library to design front end systems that can be used to display web designs. We&#39;ve also plotted different bar charts and line charts using ChartJs (open-source JavaScript library for data visualisation).

Different interactive images (gifs) and tables are also incorporated in the project.
